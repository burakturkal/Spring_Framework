Scope of Beans:
Singleton: This is the default

Prototype: This is not default. To make it work, you should write @Scope("prototype").


Eager Instintiation: Create all the beans in the beginning of the application. So they are
executed even though they are not called in main method. This is the default in Spring. This
is more popular in development.

Lazy Initiation: Create all the beans only when they are called. This is not default. To
make this, you should add @Lazy in the beginning of the class
