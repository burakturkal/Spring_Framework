Add @Component in every class that you want to make beans from

ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ConfigCourse.class);
This says go to ConfigCourse.class and see where to look for bean structures

@ComponentScan
Go to this package package com.training.stereotype_annotation;
and find the classes with @Component and create beans from those classes

With this method, you can't just print a string. In that case, you should use @Bean
annotation

-----

Wiring : This is the approach where the relationship is implemented by directly calling
@Bean annotated method from the other @Bean annotated method that defines the
second bean of the relationship.
Autowiring : This is the approach where we let Spring provide a value for a parameter
we define for the @Bean annotated method.

Check ConfigCar class to see wiring types.

We won't face a lot of wiring when we use Spring Boot because it will do all the wiring etc
