Add @Component in every class that you want to make beans from

ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ConfigCourse.class);
This says go to ConfigCourse.class and see where to look for bean structures

@ComponentScan
Go to this package package com.training.stereotype_annotation;
and find the classes with @Component and create beans from those classes

With this method, you can't just print a string. In that case, you should use @Bean
annotation
